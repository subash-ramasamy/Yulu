# Yulu - Hypothesis Testing

Assisting Yulu, India's micro-mobility provider, in understanding factors influencing shared electric cycle demand. Employing statistical tests and analysis on a dataset to identify significant predictors and gauge their impact on cycle demand.

**Key Objectives:**

- Imported and analyzed dataset structure.
- Identified relationships between "Count" and independent variables.
- Assessed "Workingday" impact on cycle rentals.
- Compared rental counts across seasons and weather conditions.
- Explored "Weather" dependence on "Season."
- Set up H0 and H1 for each test.
- Validated normality and equal variance.
- Continued analysis despite assumption failures.
- Defined alpha for hypothesis testing.
- Calculated relevant statistics for each hypothesis.
- Made informed decisions based on significance levels.
- Derived insights into factors impacting electric cycle demand.
